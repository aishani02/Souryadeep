                Wish You a very happy 23rd.You light up my world in the most beautiful ways. I love you so much. Happy birthday, sugar ball!If wishes were roses, youâ€™d be my garden.
                My love for you will never change. Even if it does, it will just grow more and more with every passing day.
                If I could afford it, Iâ€™d gift you the galaxy. Because thatâ€™s how you light up my world. I would hold your wrinkled hands and watch Abdul Bari even when we are celebrating your 80th birthday.
